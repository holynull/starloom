The CoinDesk 20 index slumped 2.86% in the past 24 hours. Solana\\'s SOL and Cardano\\'s ADA were among the biggest losers, falling 5%. BNB Chain\\'s BNB remained stable due to demand for launchpads on Binance. Bitcoin lost the $41,000 support level and traders expect prices to fall further. The downward pressure on bitcoin is attributed to sales from Grayscale\\'s GBTC bitcoin ETF.

      "\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mThe recent plummet in the cryptocurrency market can be attributed to several factors that have contributed to increased selling pressure and market volatility:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Significant Liquidations**: A notable dip occurred as Bitcoin fell below $39,000, triggering approximately $115 million in liquidations across the market in just one hour. Ethereum also experienced a 6% decline due to selling pressure from Celsius and the Ethereum Foundation. These market movements led to substantial losses for traders, particularly those anticipating price increases, with long traders losing $115 million in that timeframe. This event caused major digital currencies to see significant liquidations, affecting exchanges like Binance and OKX ([CryptoSlate](https://cryptoslate.com/bitcoin-tumbles-under-39000-triggering-115m-liquidation-in-1-hour/)).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Negative Sentiment Among Retail Investors**: A survey conducted by Deutsche Bank revealed that over one-third of retail investors believe Bitcoin's price could drop below $20,000 by the end of the year. Moreover, more respondents anticipate the disappearance of Bitcoin rather than its survival, highlighting a negative sentiment towards the cryptocurrency market ([CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/01/25/many-retail-investors-see-bitcoin-price-dropping-below-20k-by-year-end-deutsche-bank/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=rss&utm_campaign=headlines)).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Institutional Sales and ETF Impact**: The cryptocurrency market has been affected by institutional sales tied to recently launched exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This activity has led to a decrease in Bitcoin's price, with short-term investors exiting at a loss. The situation is exacerbated by the liquidation of assets by the FTX bankruptcy estate, contributing to market instability ([CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/01/23/first-mover-americas-bitcoin-slips-below-39k/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=rss&utm_campaign=headlines)).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Downgrades and Market Downturns**: Companies such as Coinbase and MicroStrategy have seen their stock values decline due to market downturns. JPMorgan downgraded Coinbase shares to underweight, citing pressures on the crypto market and potential revenue shifts away from Coinbase due to newly launched ETFs. This has contributed to the bearish sentiment in the market ([CryptoSlate](https://cryptoslate.com/bearish-bitcoin-leads-to-tumble-in-crypto-stocks-with-coinbase-taking-a-hit/)).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Wider Market Declines**: Major tokens like Solana and Avalanche have experienced significant declines due to the aforementioned factors.
